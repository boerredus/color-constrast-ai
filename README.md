# color-constrast-ai

Inspired on [WebDev Simplified's video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=60c4rMq-aH0), I implemented [BrainJS's](https://brain.js.org/#/) Neural Network to find the best constast on a random picked color.

I should say I'm not very proud of the UI I've built but I did add some interesting things, like a "real time" visulization of the Neural Network. There are also the range inputs, to change the Neural Netork's hidden layers (or clusters, as I call it).

Hope you like it. Issues and PR's are welcome!<br>
Happy coding.
